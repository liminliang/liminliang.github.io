<b>[1] Nonparameter Nonlinear Phase Noise Mitigation by Using M-ary Support Vector Machine for Coherent Optical Systems</b>

Minliang Li, Song Yu, Jie Yang, Zhixiao Chen, Yi Han, and Wanyi Gu

<b>Abstract</b>

The M-ary support vector machine (SVM) is introduced as a nonparameter nonlinear phase noise (NLPN)&nbsp;mitigation approach for the coherent optical systems. The NLPN tolerance of the system can be improved by using the M-ary SVM to conduct nonlinear detection. In this scheme, SVMs with different classification strategies are utilized to execute binary classification for signals impaired by fiber NLPN. Since the separating hyperplane of each SVM is constructed by training data, this scheme is independent from the knowledge of the transmission link. In numerical simulation, the M-ary SVM performs better than the method of amplitude-dependent phase rotation at the transmitter and receiver, as well as the maximum likelihood detection with back rotation.

<b>[3] Impact of the distribution pattern of fast polarizationscrambler on the performance of PMD mitigation with FEC for DQPSK optical system</b>

Dahai Han, Lixia Xi, Minliang Li, Haoran Chen, and Feifei Liu

<b>Abstract</b>

The combination of fast polarization scrambler (FPS) and forward error correction (FEC) is one of the methods to mitigate the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in high-speed optical fiber communication
systems. The effect of the different distribution patterns of FPS on PMD mitigation with FEC is investi-gated. A comparison of the bit error rates (BERs) between two cases where the distributed FPS is absent and present along the fiber is carried out by simulation. A novel representation called the “ring chart” to assess the performance of different distribution patterns intuitively is proposed. The results show that the distribution pattern is an impact factor for this PMD mitigation scheme.

<b>[4] Decoding Algorithm with Fast Hadamard Transform for Channel Quality Indication (CQI) in 3GPP-L TE</b>

Minliang Li, Dahai Han, Songwei Ma

<b>Abstract</b>

Channel quality indication (CQI) report is an important element of L TE and has significant impact on the system performance. The encoding method for CQI in 3GPP-LTE is Reed-Muller (RM) code and the transmission quality of CQI can be improved by channel coding with RM code. On the receiver, the contradiction between low latency which is one of goals of L TE and reliability of communication system can be eased up by fast decoding algorithms, among which Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) is described in this paper. Performance analysis as well as computer simulation of the whole process of CQI coding is also presented.

<b>[5] Research on PMD Mitigation by Using Distributed Fast Polarization Scrambling and FEC</b>

Dahai Han, Minliang Li, Lixia Xi

<b>Abstract</b>

Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is one of the major obstacles in high-speed (above 100Gbits rate) and long-haul optical communication system. The principle and performance of scrambling is introduced in this paper and the fundamental idea of improving PMD mitigation by using distributed fast polarization scrambling (D-FPS) combined with FEC is proposed, which would be a promising approach for performance improvement in ultra-high-speed optical communication system.
